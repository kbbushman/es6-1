## Quick ES6 Exercise!

We've just learned a bunch of ES6.

We've learned:

#### Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`

Remember, When declaring variables using ES6 syntax, if you need to declare a variable whose value will _not_ change, declare it as a `const`. If the variable's value _will_ or _might_ change, unless you need a global scope, you'll likely declare it as a `let`.

#### Use the arrow function `=>` to declare a function

```
const addTwo = num => {
 return num + 2;
}

```

#### Use the arrow function `=>` with implicit returns to declare a function that only returns something

```
const addTwo = num => num + 2;

```

#### Use the arrow function `=>` preserves the original `this` context

```
function eatBreakfast(pancakes) {
  var that = this;
  that.food = 'Knife please?';
  Waiter.bringCutlery(function (silverware) {
    that.food = silverware;
  });
}

```

is now

```
const eatBreakfast = pancakes => {
  this.food = 'Knife please?';
  Waiter.bringCutlery((silverware) => this.food = silverware);
}

```

#### Use literals for assigning a variable as the value of the key of the same name

The second piece of code is synonymous with the first piece of code. The second piece of code saves you from writing `price: price` when you're declaring an object key-value pair inside an object.

```
 const price = 100;
 const item = {price: price};

```

```
 const price = 100;
 const item = {price};

```

### Use template literals for string interpolation

Remember, these require you to use the `tick` ``` quotation mark. The single quote or double-quote marks won't invoke string interpolation.

```
 const greeting = name => `Hi, ${name}.`;

```

### Let's put this together.

Look at [this codepen](https://codepen.io/susir/pen/yMWvWm?editors=001). Try to modify it to ES6 syntax.

When you think you have it, look at the codepen solution [here](https://codepen.io/susir/pen/OpYvqK?editors=001).
